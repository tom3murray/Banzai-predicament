Our code can be installed by anyone with access to this repo and run on their computer with a few unique adjustments. Users will need to edit the file path's for the "CLASS" and "Irish Whiskey Sales by Volume" excel files in the "whiskey" python script to lead to the files as located on their own computer. 

### Usage of our code
As mentioned, our code is comptaible with use on any device containing a python environment. Just clone the repo, open up your environment, open our code, change the file paths, and hit "Run". We allow anyone and everyone to use and copy our code.
